I am currently pursuing my B.Sc. in Statistics while parallelly learning data science using R. An avid learner and active in different co-curriculars. 
          I love to solve problems and implementing it on my own simpler way. I have knowledge in Data Science, Machine Learning and Application Development. I am currently learning Web Development using shiny and flex framework.
